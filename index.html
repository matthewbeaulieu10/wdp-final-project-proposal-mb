    <h1>Final Project Proposal - updated 11/2</h1>
    <h2>Project Name: Flyers Dispatch</h2>

    <p>
        So the NCAA has a standard website template for each
        athletic team that is registerd as an NCAA program.
        This template has a tab for rosters and schedules. 
        Within the roster tab you can see each player, and click
        on the player to get information about them. However, 
        when trying to view statistics of players or see any
        other information about them, the website is not clear 
        and not easily readable. Same thing when going through 
        specific games within a teams schedule. It's a pain to 
        try to figure out who scored, how they scored, or really
        any information about the game except the final score. 
        So I've decided to make a website (starting just with 
        the Lewis Flyers Men's Soccer) that improves upon the 
        readabilty, usability, and style of the standard NCAA 
        program template. It will give in depth information on
        Lewis' mens soccer players and the games in which they 
        participate in.
